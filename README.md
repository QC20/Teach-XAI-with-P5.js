## Understanding Linear vs. Non-linear Gradient Descent
As a teacher looking to elucidate the nuances of gradient descent to your students, leveraging interactive visualizations can greatly enhance comprehension. In the realm of Explainable AI (XAI), P5.js provides a powerful platform to demonstrate key concepts such as linear and non-linear gradient descent.

### Linear Gradient Descent Vs Non-linear Gradient Descent
Linear gradient descent refers to the optimization process used to minimize the error of a linear model by adjusting parameters iteratively. In our P5.js visualization, students can observe a smooth, straightforward descent along a linear path towards the optimal solution. Emphasize to your students that linear gradient descent is efficient for linear models but may encounter limitations when dealing with more complex, non-linear data distributions.

On the other hand, non-linear gradient descent tackles optimization in scenarios where the relationship between inputs and outputs is non-linear. In our P5.js visualization, students will witness a more intricate descent pattern, navigating through valleys and peaks in the error landscape. Encourage students to recognize that non-linear gradient descent requires more sophisticated strategies and may be prone to getting stuck in local minima.

### Teaching Approach
Utilize the interactive P5.js visualizations in this repository to guide students through the differences between linear and non-linear gradient descent. Encourage exploration and experimentation, allowing students to manipulate parameters and observe how the optimization process unfolds in real-time. By providing hands-on experiences with these concepts, students can develop a deeper understanding of gradient descent algorithms and their implications in machine learning and AI.
