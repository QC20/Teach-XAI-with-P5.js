can you take this sketch.js and make a style.css and a index.html file to follow the same style as the other one you just made earlier in this thread? It has to have a h1 and h2 in the same style as the other can you do that? also with some nice colors as the other have. The design language needs to be somewhat similar thanks. Please also add in a return button which is able to link to a website (example.com)
